I have made a program that makes my day job easier!
I currently work as a clinical research coordinator in
ophthalmology. We have a newer study that I have
started working on so I have made a program that asks
a series of questions about patient data and matches
them to one of the three cohorts of this study.

Future planned improvements include printing the data
back to the user and states why they met either
inclusion or exclusion criteria.
